           After about 4 years of combined resturant and manufacturing experience, I decided to take a leap of faith into the world of software development. I began this next step with an immersive bootcamp offered by DevMountian, through which I have gained many of the foundational tools necessary to begin a successful carrer in this industry. I have a deep drive for continued learning, a willingness to try new things, and regardless of the outcome, make myself better. As I start this next chapter, I'm excited to apply these aspects to my new found passion for coding.

            In my free time I'm a musician who practices theory, plays shows, and collects records. I've got a Batman tattoo, and could give you a history lesson on the Skywalker family tree. I'm Colorado born and raised, and family will forever remain my top priority.
